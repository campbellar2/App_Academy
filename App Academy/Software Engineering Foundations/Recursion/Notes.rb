#### Recursion ####

#Introduction to Recursion

#Let's explore a bit of recursion as one of our last topics of the course! 
#Recursion will be covered in further courses, but let's get our feet wet for now.

#What is Recursion?

#In programming, Recursion is when a method calls itself. 
#As we have seen during the course, using helper methods can be very useful when it comes to solving problems. 
#In our classic helper method examples, we have commonly called methods from other methods. 
#Recursion is a similar process except we are calling the same method.

#As we explore recursion it is important to keep in mind all of the previous concepts we learned about methods. 
#All those method concepts will still apply to recursion!

#A Simple Recursion

#Let's write our very first (albeit broken) recursive method:
# recursive method definition:
def say_hello
     p "hello"
     say_hello
end
   
say_hello # prints "hello" forever

#Notice that the say_hello method definition contains a call to itself. 
#A recursive method definition still obeys all the evaluation rules as a normal method, so like usual, the code will not run until we call it.

#Let's step through how this code evaluates. 
#For clarity, we'll be numbering the calls to say_hello. 
#The initial call will be number 0:
     #When we call say_hello for the first time (say_hello_0), we run the code inside the definition as usual. 
     #That means we print out "hello" and call say_hello again (say_hello_1). 
     #Now we need to evaluate the call to say_hello_1.

     #say_hello_1 prints "hello" and calls say_hello_2, now we need to evaluate say_hello_2
     #say_hello_2 prints "hello" and calls say_hello_3
     #say_hello_3 prints "hello" and calls say_hello_4
     #... and this pattern continues forever!

#Our say_hello method enters an infinite loop where one call to the method triggers another call. 
#And that call triggers yet another call, etc.. 
#If you run this code, you will enter an infinite loop. 
#However, the program will crash with a SystemStackError: stack level too deep. 
#Whenever we call a method, some of our system's memory must be allocated to execute that method call. 
#This is known as adding to the stack. 
#Since our say_hello code continuously calls methods forever, we will run out of space on the stack (run out of memory) and crash!

#Recursive Countdown

#In our previous example we saw how our recursive method crashed because it entered an infinite recursive loop. 
#Of course useful recursive methods should not crash, so let's go through the process of building a working one.

#Let's build a recursive countDown that starts ticking down numbers:
def count_down(num)
     p num;
     count_down(num - 1)
end
   
count_down(10)  # this prints decreasing numbers starting at 10 forever

#This recursive definition evaluates in a similar way to before, however, now we are passing in decreasing numbers. \
#For any num, every call to countDown(num) will call countDown(num - 1), starting from our initial call to countDown(10):

     #countDown(10) prints 10 and calls countDown(9), so next we evaluate countDown(9)...
     #countDown(9) prints 9 and calls countDown(8)...
     #countDown(8) prints 8 and calls countDown(7)...
     #... and this process continues forever!
#In your mind imagine these successive calls:

#countDown(10) -> countDown(9) -> countDown(8) ...

#Our countdown crashes with a similar error as last time because we entered an infinite loop again. 
#Hmmm, what if we modify our method so that it stops at 0:
def count_down(num)
     if num == 0
          p "Houston, we have lift-off!"
          return;
     end
   
     p num
     count_down(num - 1)
end
   
count_down(10)  # prints numbers from 10 to 1, and finally "Houston, we have lift-off!"

#Now our method stops once we hit 0! 
#Let's say we get to the point where we evaluate countDown(0). 
#That means that the if condition is true, so we print the lift-off message and return. 
#Recall that as soon as we hit a return we exit that method call immediately. 
#Since we immediately return out of our call to countDown(0), countDown(0) never calls countDown(-1), breaking our recursive loop!

#Anatomy of a Recursive Method

#In recursive methods, we need to implement a way to stop the recursive loop and prevent it from looping forever. 
#We took care of the infinite loop issue in our countDown by using an if statement that prevents another recursive call. 
#In general, we call such a statement the base case

#A recursive method consists of two fundamental parts:
     #the base case where we halt the recursion by not making a further call
     #the recursive step where we continue the recursion by making another subsequent call
def count_down(num)
     # base case
     if num == 0
          p "Houston, we have lift-off!"
          return;
     end
      
     p num
     # recursive step
     count_down(num - 1)
end


##Recursive Factorial Notes

#factorial
#Recall our factorial problem from earlier in the course:
# Write a method `factorial(n)` which takes a number and returns the factorial of n.
# A factorial is the product of all whole numbers between 1 and n, inclusive.
# For example, `factorial(5)` is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

#How can we solve this problem using recursion? 
#Notice that the structure of factorial has us take decreasing numbers similar to the countDown. 
#However, this time we need to keep multiplying them together.

#If we lay out the math used to calculate the factorial of some numbers, we'll notice a pattern:
# factorial(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
# factorial(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
# factorial(3) = 3 * 2 * 1
# factorial(2) = 2 * 1
# factorial(1) = 1 (base case)
#In the outline above, notice that as the input number becomes smaller and smaller, the problem we solve also becomes smaller. 
#There are less multiplications that need to take place!

#Let's see the pattern programmatically. 
#We can find the factorial of a number by using the factorial of another number:
# factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)
# factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3)
# factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2)
# factorial(2) = 2 * factorial(1)
# factorial(1) = 1 (base case)
#Or in general, if n is some number:

     #factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1)
     #factorial(1) = 1
#Now let's implement factorial with some recursive Ruby:
def factorial(n)
     return 1 if n == 1
     n * factorial(n - 1);
end
   
factorial(5) # => 120

#Note that mathematically, factorial(0) = 1 so we could have also used that as the base case.

#Solving a Problem Recursively:
#Because every recursive problem must have a base and recursive case, we can follow these steps to help us write a recursive method:

     #Identify the base case in the problem and code it. 
     #The base case should explicitly handle the scenario(s) where the arguments are so trivially "small", that we immediately know the result without further calculation. 
     #Be sure it works by testing it.

     #Solve the next level of the problem, using the result of the base case. 
     #Test it.

     #Modify the code in step 2, generalizing it for every level of the problem.

#Recursive Fib Notes

#fib

#Let's take a look at a classic recursive problem. 
#The fibonacci sequence!
# Write a method fib(n) that takes in a number and returns the nth number of
# the fibonacci sequence.
# In the fibonacci sequence, the 1st number is 1 and the 2nd number is 1. To generate the
# next number in the sequence, we take the sum of the previous two fibonacci numbers.
# For example the first 5 numbers of the fibonacci sequence are `1, 1, 2, 3, 5`

# Examples:

# fib(1) # => 1
# fib(2) # => 1
# fib(3) # => 2
# fib(4) # => 3
# fib(5) # => 5
# fib(6) # => 8
# fib(7) # => 13

#To get a fibonacci number, we need to take the sum of the previous two. 
#Take a look at the following ways we can describe fib.

# fib(5) = fib(4) + fib(3)
# fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2)
# fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1)
# fib(2) = 1 base case
# fib(1) = 1 base case

#In general:

     #fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

#Finally, let's implement fib using code:
def fib(n)
     return 1 if n == 1 || n == 2
     fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
end

#This should feel like magic! 
#To make sense of recursive code like fib, use abstraction and your comfort with helper methods. 
#Recursion is only "different" from using regular helper methods because we are using the same method as the helper. 
#However, you can use abstraction in the same way. 
#If we want to solve fib(5) we can decompose it into fib(4) + fib(3)! 
#Take a second to appreciate the beauty of our recursive fib method! So cool.

#When is recursion appropriate?
#Recursion allows us to solve problems in an elegant way. 
#However, recursion is a tool that is only appropriate for certain problems. 
#Look to the structure of a problem to figure out if it can be solved recursively. 
#Recursion is used to solve problems that can be decomposed into smaller versions of the same problem. 
#For example we can decompose fib(n) into fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2). 
#Intuitively, we know that fib(n - 1) is a "smaller" or "easier" problem than fib(n). 
#The easiest subproblem is fib(1) or fib(2) because the answer is simply 1; this is an assumption in the fibonacci sequence. 
#We use the easiest subproblems as the base case in recursion.
